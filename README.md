# BitsOfC

This is my personal practice repository for learning and exploring the C programming language.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- Practice writing C programs as I learn the language
- Build a habit of solving problems with code
- Track my progress and share it in one place

## ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here

- Basic programs (Hello World, calculator, etc.)
- Practice exercises (loops, arrays, functions)
- Mini-projects (bill generator, simple games, etc.)
- Comments and notes in code for learning

## ðŸ“… Current Status

I'm a beginner in C (started in 2025), and this repo will grow as I learn more concepts like:

- Loops and conditions
- Functions and arrays
- Strings and pointers
- File handling and structs
- C projects and mini tools

> ðŸ’¬ I'm still learning. Expect beginner-level code, mistakes, and progress.  
Feel free to fork or suggest improvements if you're ahead of me.
